# Function:
#	 Access Control for this smtp server - determines:
#		 * Who we accept mail from
#		 * Who we accept relaying from
#		 * Who we will not send to
#
# Usage:
#	 FEATURE(access_db[, type [-o] /etc/mail/access])dnl
#	 makemap hash access < access
#
# Format:
#	 lhs:
#		 email addr		 <user@[host.domain]>
#		 domain name	 unless  FEATURE(relay_hosts_only) is used,
#			 then this is a fqdn - and relay-domains ($=R)
#			 must also be fqdns.
#		 network number  must end on an octet boundary, or
#			 you're stuck going the longwinded way ;-{
#	 rhs:
#		 OK				 accept mail even if other rules in the
#						 running ruleset would reject it.
#		 RELAY			 Allow domain to relay through your SMTP
#						 server.  RELAY also serves an implicit
#						 OK for the other checks.
#		 REJECT			 reject the sender/recipient with a general
#						 purpose message that can be customized.
#						 confREJECT_MSG [550 Access denied] will be issued
#		 DISCARD		 discard the message completely using
#						 the $#discard mailer.
#		 ### any text	 where ### is an RFC 821 compliant error code
#				 and "any text" is a message to return for
#			 the command
# Examples:
#	spammer@aol.com			REJECT
#	FREE.STEALTH.MAILER@	550 Spam not accepted
#
# Notes:
#	With FEATURE(blacklist_recipients) this is also possible:
#	badlocaluser				 550 Mailbox disabled for this username
#	host.mydomain.com			 550 That host does not accept mail
#	user@otherhost.mydomain.com  550 Mailbox disabled for this recipient
